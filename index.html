                <p>
                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rafael-pieslak/" target="_blank">printing and typesetting</a> industry. 
                    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
                    when an unknown <a href="mailto:rafael.pieslak@gmail.com">printer</a> took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
                    specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap 
                    into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
                    It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing 
                    Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software 
                    like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
